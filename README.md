# Proxmox-DPM
A Distributed Power Management System for Proxmox Clusters. Start Nodes only when needed.

## the idea
Are you running a Proxmox cluster at home or at work and you do not need the full capacity of every server always online? 
Proxmox-DPM is a distributed power managment system for exactly that. I starts and stops nodes of your cluster based on the usage of the other nodes so you only have running what you need.
